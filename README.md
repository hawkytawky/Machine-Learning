# Business Analytics and Data Science
The module Business Analytics and Data Science (BADS) is concerned with theories, concepts, and practices to support decision-making by means of formal, data-driven methods. We discuss a broad set of models for descriptive and predictive analytics. However, predictive analytics is the main focus of the course. Many corporate use cases of analytics and data science involve predicting some future state or behavior, for example, how customers will respond to certain marketing stimuli. We will introduce statistical principles of learning from data and cover several common prediction methods, ranging from established industry workhorses like logistic regression to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting.
